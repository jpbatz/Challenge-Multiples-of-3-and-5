#Multiples of 3 and 5

##Challenge 1

    From Project Euler Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Clone this project, write the body of the function **sumOfAMultiple** so that the jasmine tests pass.
The function will return the sum of all the multiples of **3** or **5** below **n**.

There are **4** tests, once your tests pass, uncomment the last two and fill in the correct result.

(you'll need jasmine-node)
````
npm install jasmine-node -g
````

run automated tests by running  
````
jasmine-node --autotest .
````

##OR

use mocha chai
````
npm install mocha -g
npm install chai        // install in project dir!
````

npm init                // accept defaults

npm install -D chai

edit test file

run automated tests by running  
````
mocha -w spec           // no need to terminate and restart mocha every time test file is saved  
````
